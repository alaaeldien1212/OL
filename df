Key Adjustments Needed:

Remove "Baloo 2", "Fredoka", "Inter", "Nunito" references
Arabic fonts need special attention for readability
2. RTL (Right-to-Left) by Default
dir="rtl" on all pages by default
All layouts mirror: navigation, cards, progress bars flow right-to-left
Icons and arrows flip direction
3. Content & UI
All interface text in Arabic
All stories in Arabic
All forms and questions in Arabic
All error messages, notifications, feedback in Arabic
4. Design System Tokens
Font families updated to Arabic-optimized fonts
Line-height may need adjustment (Arabic text often needs more vertical space)
Letter-spacing considerations for Arabic
Would you like me to:
Update the Style document to reflect Arabic-only design with proper Arabic font specifications?
Create an updated design system with Arabic typography tokens?
Prepare specific RTL layout guidelines for the development team?
